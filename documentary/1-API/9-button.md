## Button

The package provides the implementation of the Sign-In button with CSS and HTML. It was added in favour of the static image button to be able to switch background color on hover, and instead of an SVG button because problems will arise when placing SVG into an `a` element.

```table
[
  ["![Default Button](img/linkedin.png)", "The default Linked In button."],
  ["![Idio Linkedin Button](img/button.png)", "Idio's button CSS+HTML implementation. It supports `hover`, `active` and `focus` properties."]
]
```
